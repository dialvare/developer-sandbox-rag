# Adding a GPU Node Pool to AI Clusters

Your Developer Sandbox is active for 30 days and has specific built-in functionality. However, in some scenarios, we may be able to modify this time allotment and other default settings. If you want to request a change, please contact the team creating the Developer Sandbox. Make sure to include a little information about who you are and why you need these changes. 

Most settings and management needs can be taken care of from within your cluster interface itself. Learn about developer-focused features in the OpenShift Developer Console.

## What is the Developer Sandbox?

The Developer Sandbox is a free, no-commitment trial environment. It gives users private access to a shared, multi-tenant OpenShift cluster pre-configured with select Red Hat technologies.

## What is my cost for the Developer Sandbox?

It is free. There is no credit card required. All you need is a Red Hat account.

## Can I deploy my software on the Developer Sandbox?

That’s the idea! You’ll find that some software will deploy as-is, while other code might require some minor changes. You’ll quickly see how easy it is to create a container running your software on your cluster. Java, Node.js, Python, Go, C#, and more are supported.

## We’re not a Red Hat Enterprise Linux or a Red Hat customer. Can we still use the Developer Sandbox?

Absolutely. You don’t need to install anything to get started. You may want to  install a command-line tool  for your environment (Linux, macOS, or Windows -- all are welcome), but it’s not necessary.

## Which developer tools are available in my Developer Sandbox?

We have a broad understanding of what it means to be a developer. Whether you're developing automation, LLMs or more traditional code we've got you covered. We provide the developer experience on OpenShift, including a catalog of Helm charts, Red Hat builder images, s2i build tool, OpenShift AI, and OpenShift Dev Spaces.

## How can I install additional developer tools in my Developer Sandbox?

The Developer Sandbox provides a pre-configured set of tools and services. We would love to learn from you about other tools and services that we should consider adding to the sandbox. 

## How long can my pods run in the Developer Sandbox?

All user pods can run for 12 (twelve) consecutive hours before they are automatically deleted. However, your applications are still available. All you need to do is start a pod.

## Why do I have to validate my phone number to access the Developer Sandbox?

We require a valid phone number to reduce the creation of fraudulent accounts on the Developer Sandbox. Red Hat will not use this information for any other reason, and you will never receive a phone call from Red Hat or any third party as a result of trying the Developer Sandbox.
